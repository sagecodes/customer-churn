# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to write clean code to predict customer churn of a telecom company. The data set is provided by IBM. The data set contains information about customers who left the company within the last month. The data set includes information about:

* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
